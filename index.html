<p>(This man is an absolute lunatic)</p>
<p>(Here's another paragraph because why not)</p>
<p>Here's a paragraph with <br>a break</p>

<p>Here is another paragraph to show</p>
<hr>
<p>what the "hr" tag does in HTML</p>
<p>Wanna see a "pre" element? I do!</p>
<pre>
    Roses are Red
    Walls are made of Plaster
    The Children were Fast
    But Big Bird was Faster
</pre>
<p>I'm bored. Let me change the font color.</p>
<p style="background-color:darkred">Whoops! This is the background color!</p>
<p style="color:darkred">This is a little better. Though hard to read with a white background. I'll go back to normal black and white.</p>
<p>Back to normal. I want to be a little fancier, though.</p>
<p style="font-family:cursive">This is much fancier. But honestly, it would strain my eyes to look at this too long. Especially on a pixellated computer screen. Maybe if it's a little bigger?</p>
<p style="font-family:cursive; font-size:300%;">WHOAH! TOO BIG! If I wanted this I use an h1 element.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This feels okay... but it clashes with the rest of the website. You can see how I have a set theme before this?<br>I don't want to go back and make everything before centered. Too much effort.<br>Not to mention, this opens up the possibility of inserting ads along the sides. I hate ads.</p>
<p>Now time for some formatting. <br><b>Here's some BOLD.</b> <br><strong>This strong text is not bolded, you dimwit.</strong> <br><i>I want this to stand out, but not too much</i>. <br><em>This is emphasized. What the heck is the difference between emphasizing something and italicising it?</em> <br><mark>This text is marked,</mark> <small>and this is small.</small> <br><del>Whoops, I wasn't supposed to write this!</del> <ins>This goes in its place.</ins> <br>Check the footnotes<sup>(there are actually none)</sup> and <sub>this</sub> is for how many molecules are in something. H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
